    "Python has two flavors -- Python 2 and Python 3. This set of examples are in Python 3, written and executed in the beautifully simple IDE Jupyter Notebook. Note that Jupyter has set up a `localhost:8888` server to render the notebook in your computer's browser. It can render anything now -- should be fun!\n",
